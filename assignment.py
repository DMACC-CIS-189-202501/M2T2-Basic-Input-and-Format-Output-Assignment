# TODO 1: Add your Doc String


# TODO 2: Use a constant to store the number of scores you will ask for, `NUM_SCORES`


# TODO 3: Prompt the user for input, get their first name, last name, age, and ask them for 3 scores
##  Store into local variables `last_name`, `first_name`, `age`
### Prompt the user for the three scores, storing them in local variable or variables
### You can keep separate variables for each score, or you keep a running total in one variable. 



#TODO 4: Calculate the average using the stored inputs (aka the 3 scores).
# please assign the total to a variable named `total`, and the average scores to a variable named 'avg_score'
## Hint 1: If needed, refer to module 1 homework on how we can cast from a str to an int
## Hint 2: If needed, the average is calculated by adding all values then dividing by the number of values, such as [26, 29] the average would be (26+29)/2= 27.5



#TODO 5: Print the output, with last name followed by a comma and the first name followed by an integer age and then the average scores with 2 decimal places
## Example Output:
### Rodriguez, Linda age: 21 average grade: 92.50
